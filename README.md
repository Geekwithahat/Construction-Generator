# Construction Generator
Masters project to create a HDA generating construction timelapses of geometry for MSc CAVE course at Bournemouth University. 


## Usage note: 

1.6 version functions best when geometry is generated with lowest point at Y position 0 (I.e upon a default ground plane) and then moved into position afterwards.

It is worth acknowledging that the 1.7 varient of the asset fully addresses these concerns, however due to time restriction was unnable to fully pass blackbox testing or receive readability alterations before the deadline and therefore remains somewhat untested.
