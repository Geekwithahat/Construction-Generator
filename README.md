# Construction Generator
Masters project to create a HDA generating construction timelapses of geometry for MSc CAVE course at Bournemouth University. 


## Usage note: 

Functions best when geometry is generated with lowest point at Y position 0 (I.e upon a default ground plane) and then moved into position afterwards.
